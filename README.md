# Multilingual Efficient and Effective Passage Search
## Brief Description
The purpose of the study is to develop mColBERT (Multilingual ColBERT), a search engine capable of effectively retrieving information across multiple languages. Additionally, this research explores the effectiveness of mColBERT across different languages and investigates the factors contributing to performance variations. Furthermore, the research aims to un- derstand the curse of multilinguality, of which pre-trained multilingual models often show many language weaknesses compared to monolingual counterparts in monolingual settings. To investigate this, the research evaluates the performance of ColBERT and mColBERT on same-language open-domain QA tasks.
